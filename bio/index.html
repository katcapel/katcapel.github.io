    </h1>
    <p>
        Kat Capel is an experimental writer and co-progenitor of expanded literary practice space ReadtheRoom. Their writing utilizes the fractured poetics of found text, conversation and memory to lure meaning from real or imagined events of political love, horniness, place, grief and gender. Capel refuses traditional literary dichotomies such as fiction/nonfiction and poetry/prose/screenwriting, focusing instead on representing a kind of emotional reality through a merging of forms.
